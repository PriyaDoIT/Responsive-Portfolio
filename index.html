				Hello and welcome to my site!  My name is Priya Shah and I hail from Chicago, IL.  A little bit about me professionally:  I studied economics and International Studies at the University of Wisconsin at Madison (Go Badgers!).  I then spend about 6 years at an investment research firm called Morningstar.  I thought my career would take me down the finance path, but that has been far from the truth.  I quickly realized that no matter what industry you work in today, to keep up (and to move up, for that matter) you must have some type technical acumen.  During my time at Morningstar I worked on a variety of financial products.  To build these products, I had to learn how to bridge the gap between business requirements and development teams.  As I gained more experience, I started to get more interested on the tech side more so than finance, so I applied to the City of Chicago’s Department of Innovation and Technology where I worked as a Project Manager on their Data and Analytics team.  I probably worked on some of the most fascinating projects in my career to date.  I lead open sourced data science projects that impacted the lives of everyday Chicagoans; from using data science to prevent children from getting lead positioning to preventing food born illnesses.  One of the open source projects that I worked on was selected by Mozilla for their Open Source Leadership Training, where I had the opportunity to learn the best practices for leading open source projects—this was an eye-opening experience for me as I lead my first hackathon and met so many people who went from not knowing how to code at all to spending their free time attending these types of events.  From there I knew I had to enroll in a boot camp and here I am today.

Now let’s get personal.  I am happily married to my husband who is a Harvard trained doctor and is doing some great things in the medical community, specifically for the opioid epidemic.  I am very proud of all that he has accomplished.  When we aren’t working, we love to travel.  I have traveled to a total of 26 countries and so far my favorite has been Japan, mainly because you can get warm coffee out of a vending machine there.  When I am not at coding bootcamp, you can find me running around Chicago.  My greatest achievement is running the Chicago Marathon in 2013 and I hope to run it again in 2018.
